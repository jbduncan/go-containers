# go-containers
A library of Go data structures with generics support.

# Developer setup

1. Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev), which sets up and manages everything.
   - Make sure that mise is [in your shell config](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/activate.html#mise-activate), then source your shell config again.
2. Open the terminal in this directory and run:
   1. `mise trust`
   2. `mise i`
   > Go and all other tools will now be installed on the PATH when inside this directory.
3. Optionally:
   1. Set up [mise auto-completion](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#autocompletion) in your terminal.
   2. [Set up your IDE](https://mise.jdx.dev/ide-integration.html) to use the mise-managed Go.
