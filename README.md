# Developer setup

   - Make sure that mise is in your shell configuration file as per https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/activate.html#mise-activate.
   - Make sure to re-source your shell configuration or restart the terminal for changes to take effect.
2. Open the terminal in this directory and run:
   1. `mise trust`
   2. `mise i`
   > Go and all other tools will now be installed on the PATH when inside this directory.
3. Optionally:
   1. Set up mise auto-completion in your terminal by following https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#autocompletion.
